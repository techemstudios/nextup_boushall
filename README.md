## Starting Pygame  

Pygame is part of the Python framework including tools to create video games. What does Pygame have, that allows us to do create games? It is built on top of the Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL), a C framework which gives access to a range of graphics, sounds, keyboard handlers, and other input devices on various operating systems including Linux, MAC OS X, and Windows. -*Instant Pygame for Python Game Development, Ivan Idris*
